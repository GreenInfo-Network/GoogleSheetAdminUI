<li>Select three columns: the Address field, then the corresponding Lat and Lng fields immediately right of the Address cell. You may select one row or many rows, and the address lookup will happen for each set of the cells.</li>
<li>Go to the Geocode menu and select "Geocode Address to Lat and Lng". It does take a moment. Be patient and wait for the script to run.</li>
<li>Addresses which could not be found, will have their Lat and Lng left blank. Either correct the address, or fill in a Lat and Lng manually.</li>
<li>You may change the Lat and Lng for an address, if the geocoder gave coordinates that aren't quite to your liking.</li>
